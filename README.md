## **CySeck's Cybersecurity Finishing School program - Projects and walkthroughs**


This repository represents my hands-on work completed during an intensive, domain-focused **CySeck's Cybersecurity Finishing School program**.  
It is designed to reflect **real execution**, **daily accountability**, and **professional security practices**, rather than theoretical learning or course notes.

The work here is built incrementally — day by day — following how cybersecurity skills are actually developed in industry:  
**observe → practice → analyze → document**.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to demonstrate:

- Consistent hands-on engagement with cybersecurity concepts
- Ability to translate learning into practical execution
- Structured documentation and version control discipline
- A defensive-security mindset aligned with real-world environments

This is not a showcase of certificates or syllabus coverage —  
it is a **working security journal backed by execution**.
